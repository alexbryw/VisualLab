# Visual Lab   
## Interactive learning in a 3D environment.   
### Made with React-Native EXPO for mobiles and uses THREE.JS (React-three-Fiber) for the 3D elements.  
An educational app for learning in 3D.
This first version contains a Unit Circle simulator where the user will learn about degrees in a circle, sine, cosine, and angles. In future releases more advanced topics could be covered like waves and interference patterns in a 3D environment and could be connected to a backend server to save progress and to share scores with other users.
